This project was started in September, while learning the basics of java. I fell in love with the language as I learned it, and wanted something fun to work on while I learned. 
In doing this project, I ended up learning many java concepts before they were taught in class, and accelerated my learning while creating something I thought was interesting. 
While the project is very far from perfect, I am proud of making something mostly functional, and have developed a passion for computer science as a field through my two introductory classes and this project.
